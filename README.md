# Painless LeetCode

A browser add-on that aims to make LeetCode a bit more painless.

## 📖 LeetCode

LeetCode is a website that offers a variety of coding problems and a platform to practice them. While I love LeetCode, I sometimes wish some of its features did not exist in the first place.

## 🚀 Add-on Features

- Disable Ctrl+Enter shortcut automatically. This prevents accidental code submissions and can help you maintain your acceptance rate.

This project is currently in development so feature set is limited. Please file a PR or an issue if you have any suggestions.
